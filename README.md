## Project Overview

This is a practical backend project that serves as a foundation for understanding how REST APIs work using Express.js. It includes examples of routing, controllers, and basic logic to process data sent through HTTP requests. The goal is to offer a base for future projects or continued learning.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js  
- Express.js  
- JavaScript (ES6)

## Project Structure

/ProyectPracticeApiRestExpresss-main
│

├── /routes # Contains route definitions

├── /controllers # Logic and handlers for each route

├── app.js # Main server setup with Express

└── package.json # Project configuration and dependencies



This structure follows a modular pattern, separating concerns for better maintainability.

## Features

- Basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Clean and modular architecture using routes and controllers
- Simple JSON-based request and response handling
- Easily extendable structure for adding new features
- Educational focus for beginners learning backend development

## Installation

To install and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/ErickFullDevelop/ProyectPracticeApiRestExpresss-main.git



2. Navigate into the project folder:
cd ProyectPracticeApiRestExpresss-main



3. Install dependencies:
npm install



## Running the Server

To start the server, run the following command:

node app.js



By default, the server will be available at:

http://localhost:3000



You can change the port if needed in the `app.js` file.

## Example API Endpoints

Below are example endpoints that could be used in this API. These should be adapted based on your actual implementation.

- GET `/students` – Retrieve all students
- POST `/students` – Add a new student
- PUT `/students/:id` – Update a student by ID
- DELETE `/students/:id` – Delete a student by ID

These endpoints can be tested using tools like Postman, Insomnia, or curl.
